Holding down on the screen will start to make a bubble that starts small and grows until mouse up

On a certain keycombination, open the settings window.
Here you can select the increase rate, the speed at which a bubble grows when adding to the window
change the color
start size
mass


Dont use a random outward movement, and always have the bubbles go straight outward at a refular angle intervale

collision will make the bubbles combine masses (and have the net velocity of the two bubbles)

Use radius (calculated from mass) to draw the bubble
