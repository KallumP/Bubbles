Settings:
Here you can select the increase rate, the speed at which a bubble grows when adding to the window
change the color
start size
mass

on settings load, set the debug trigger start and end size




Functionality:
collision will make the bubbles combine masses (and have the net velocity of the two bubbles)

Use radius (calculated from mass) to draw the bubble

Holding down on the screen will start to make a bubble that starts small and grows until mouse up

maybe use a static environment reference instead of having a reference for each object

stop floating point from rounding to zero, by constraining it to 1 increment above 0


Rockets:
maybe inherit from the bubbles class

rockets will eventually have fuel that when used, slowly gets lighter

When a rocket collides, resnap it, but still apply force (collided mode). 
If the force's center of mass direction component is negative (pointing away from the mass), then let it get attracted to wards that force
