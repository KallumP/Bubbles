Settings:

change the color

on settings load, set the debug trigger start and end size





Functionality:

collided bubble should have the net velocity of the two original bubbles

maybe use a static environment reference instead of having a reference for each object

scalable viewport (times or divide the draw coordinates to fit in the new viewport)





Rockets:

maybe inherit from the mass class (same goes for bubbles)

rockets will have fuel that when used, slowly gets lighter
