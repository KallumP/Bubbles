Settings:
On a certain keycombination, open the settings window.
Here you can select the increase rate, the speed at which a bubble grows when adding to the window
change the color
start size
mass

Animate the debug part (slowly make the window larger, and move the buttons up from the bottom)




Functionality:
Dont use a random outward movement, and always have the bubbles go straight outward at a refular angle intervale

collision will make the bubbles combine masses (and have the net velocity of the two bubbles)

Use radius (calculated from mass) to draw the bubble

Holding down on the screen will start to make a bubble that starts small and grows until mouse up

rockets
snap to a bubble, and on space lift off
maybe inherit from the bubbles class
rockets will eventually have fuel that when used, slowly gets lighter
when removing the rocket, check to see if it hasnt taken off yet

trail of bubbles locations

drawvector debug setting should be static andin bubble

update the rockets position each tick so tht it stays snapped to a bubble
