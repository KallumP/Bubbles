Settings:
Here you can select the increase rate, the speed at which a bubble grows when adding to the window
change the color
start size
mass



Functionality:

collision will make the bubbles combine masses (and have the net velocity of the two bubbles)

Use radius (calculated from mass) to draw the bubble

Holding down on the screen will start to make a bubble that starts small and grows until mouse up

trail of bubbles locations

draw velocity debug setting should be static and in bubble

Don't use IDs, just remove from the bubble object itself as the identifier

rockets
maybe inherit from the bubbles class

rockets will eventually have fuel that when used, slowly gets lighter

update the rockets position each tick so tht it stays snapped to a bubble

When a rocket collides, resnap it, but still apply force (collided mode). 
If the force's center of mass direction component is negative (pointing away from the mass), then let it get attracted to wards that force

use a tempSnapped mode to signify that the rocket has snapped to a bubble but is still a temp rocket

Use an interface to check if something should be attracted

when a bubble collides, resnap if the one of the two bubbles contained a rocket (loop through each rocket and see if the bubbles being removed were in that rocekt)
