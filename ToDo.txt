Settings:
Here you can select the increase rate, the speed at which a bubble grows when adding to the window
change the color
start size
mass

on settings load, set the debug trigger start and end size



Functionality:
collided bubble should have the net velocity of the two original bubbles

Use radius (calculated from mass) to draw the bubble

Holding down on the screen can start to make a bubble that starts small and grows until mouse up

maybe use a static environment reference instead of having a reference for each object

scalable viewport (times or divide the draw coordinates to fit in the new viewport)

make masses tick multiple times depending on the speed (Maybe constrain the speed to 1-2-3-4)

Rockets:
maybe inherit from the bubbles class

rockets will eventually have fuel that when used, slowly gets lighter
