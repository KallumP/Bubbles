Functionality:

scalable viewport (times or divide the draw coordinates to fit in the new viewport)

Change the speed value in the environment to not be static

Change divideBy into multiplyBy and change each exisiting reference to pass in 1/x instead of the current x

collided bubble should have the net velocity of the two original bubbles
need to use momentum to figure out how fast the new bubble should travel

ability to move bubbles by clicking on them

need to fix terminal velocity (when letting go of a bubble, it snaps to the terminal vel speed)
instead, slowly approach it, (like air resistance)



Optimisations:

Check to see if a bubble is in effective range before applying gravity to it.
(need to find out what the effective range is)

maybe use a static environment references instead of having a reference for each object

move if gravity should effect to the bubble class that returns a bool and call that 
instead of having a long list of if statements in the environment class

bubble.checkclick should return a value
stop searching through bubbles if the returned value was true



Rockets:

maybe inherit from the mass class (same goes for bubbles)

rockets will have fuel that when used, slowly gets lighter



Settings:

ability to change the color of bubbles

on settings load, set the debug trigger start and end size
