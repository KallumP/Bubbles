Functionality:

maybe use a static environment references instead of having a reference for each object

scalable viewport (times or divide the draw coordinates to fit in the new viewport)

Change the speed value in the environment to not be static

Change divideBy into multiplyBy and change each exisiting reference to pass in 1/x instead of the current x

collided bubble should have the net velocity of the two original bubbles
need to use momentum to figure out how fast the new bubble should travel





Rockets:

maybe inherit from the mass class (same goes for bubbles)

rockets will have fuel that when used, slowly gets lighter



Settings:

ability to change the color of bubbles

on settings load, set the debug trigger start and end size
