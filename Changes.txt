A lot of methods were updated to be consistent (mostly event methods)
Mouse interactions added. The user can now click and drag bubbles about

v7
presets made scalable to the center of the screen (no the size of the screen)
program timer can be slowed and sped up using the less than and greater than keys (0.1 - 1)
program speed can now be updated using the number keys (works up to 9 times as fast)
