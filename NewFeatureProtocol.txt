When adding a new mode:


1. Add the mode to the MainWindow class's InteractiveModes enumerator

2. Update the "SwitchModes" method with the new mode

3. Add the new mode to the options window (add mode switch, and update correct radio button on click)

4. Make sure the environment checks for the new mode in each of it's event methods



After pushing, check the github changes, 
and make sure that any new method parameters have their xml documentatino comments added
